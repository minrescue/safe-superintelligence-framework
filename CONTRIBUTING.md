# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution.

## Scope

This repository is primarily a normative and technical-policy document set (not an implementation library).
Changes should improve clarity, internal consistency, auditability, and practical usefulness.

## How to contribute

1. Open an issue describing:
   - the problem you are addressing
   - the proposed change
   - the expected impact on safety and governance
2. Submit a pull request with:
   - a concise diff
   - rationale in the PR description
   - any relevant references or threat-model notes

## Safety and dual-use

Do not submit exploitative instructions or sensitive operational details (bio/chem/cyber).
When discussing defensive measures, use *minimum necessary disclosure*.

## Style

- Prefer precise language over rhetorical flourish.
- Keep definitions explicit; avoid ambiguous terms without operational meaning.
- When adding new rules, specify how they interact with the value hierarchy and invariants.
